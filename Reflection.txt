Which data type decision was most important in your app and why?

The most important data type decision made in this app was using the decimal for the constant TaxRate. The reason why it is the most important decision is because using a double would have caused rounding errors, and an int is a whole number. For something like a tax rate, decimals give the most accuracy. When displaying prices and calculating tax, inaccuracies are unacceptable. Having the constant as a decimal for currency ensures the most accuracy and consistency. Decimals are the preferred option for currency. Doubles are better for scientific calculations, and ints are better when a whole number is involved.
